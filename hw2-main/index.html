                <p>Hello, I am Bishop Devkota. I am a sophomore pursuing a bachelor's degree in data science, and I am planning to add a second major. 
                    I like to play video games mostly shooters, like Valorant, Fortune, and Marvel Rivals. I also like to work out and play pickleball. 
                    I also love watching football and my favorite teams are the Packers and Eagles (we are going to destroy the Commanders this week).
                    Another sport I like watching is soccer my favorite team is Man City, I am also a Messi fan. In addition to these two sports, I also love watching the UFC.
